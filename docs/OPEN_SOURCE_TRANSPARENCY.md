# Gorilla Unleashed - Open Source Transparency & Reproducibility Report

## Project Philosophy
In the spirit of the pure open-source movement, this document provides a comprehensive audit trail of the modifications, scripts, and configurations applied to create the **GNU IceCat (Firefox 152+) "Gorilla" Hybrid Build** paired with the highly tuned **Linux 7.0.5+Gorilla.Unleashed.Ultimate.20Gbps Kernel**.

## 1. "Total Hybridization" Strategy
**Rationale:** We merge the strict privacy framework of GNU IceCat (Defense-in-Depth) with aggressive "Gorilla Excision" (purging FOG, Glean, Telemetry, and AI components) to form an incredibly lightweight, secure, and fast browser environment.

## 2. Advanced Kernel Orchestration
**Rationale:** Standard generic kernels leave massive performance on the table. The "Gorilla Ultimate 20Gbps" kernel applies surgical hardware targeting:
- **Optimization Flags:** `-O3 -march=ivybridge -mtune=ivybridge` directly targeting the i7-3632QM.
- **20Gbps Networking:** Integration of BBR, FQ, XDP Sockets, and hardware crypto offloading to saturate modern high-speed links (benefiting Telegram Web, WhatsApp Web, Deluge).
- **RAM Protection:** Strict `tcp_mem` bounds (`786432 1048576 1572864`) to prevent OOM panics on 16GB systems.
- **Desktop Responsiveness:** Switched from `NO_HZ_FULL` to `NO_HZ_IDLE` combined with Wayland KMS tuning for Intel HD 4000 / Radeon HD 7670M.
- **Storage:** Hardcoded `SATA AHCI` and `BFQ` scheduler to perfectly match the Kingston DC600M Enterprise SSD.

## 3. Transparent Build Automation
Every aspect of this build is transparent, fully logged, and 100% reproducible via shell scripts rather than hidden binary patching.
- **Master Script:** `ULTIMATE_GORILLA_KERNEL.sh`
- **1-Click Execution:** `1_CLICK_BUILD_KERNEL.sh`
- **Audit Logs:** See `Execution_Log_20260510.md` for a precise breakdown of agent actions and parameter injections.

## 4. How to Replicate or Audit
- **Audit:** Read the `.sh` scripts. They dynamically pull pristine source code (e.g., `linux-7.0.5.tar.xz`), inject C patches (like the 40dB ALC269 Sound Boost), and map configurations in real-time. 
- **Replicate:** Run `1_CLICK_BUILD_KERNEL.sh` on an identical hardware profile to perfectly reproduce the Debian kernel packages.
